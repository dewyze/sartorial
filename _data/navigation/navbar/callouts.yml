left_center_right_mobile:
  kind: warning
  content: | 
    When using a left/center/right navbar, note that in order for it to appear correctly on mobile you will need to specify outside of the sections what should appear in the uncollapsed section. E.g. the word logo is <code class="scss-var">.navbar-mobile-only</code> and the centered logo has the class <code class="scss-var">.navbar-desktop-only</code>.
navbar_container:
  kind: warning
  content: | 
    The <code>.navbar</code> element does not need a surrounding container. It will respect the <code>$container-width</code> variable and center the nav. <br /> <br /> <code>.container</code> elements contain padding by default. If you had a <code>.container.no-pad</code> element around a nav, it would function the same way.
navbar_full_width:
  kind: info
  content: | 
    Use the <code>.full-width</code> class if you want the navbar to expand to the full size of the screen.
navbar-item-right:
  kind: warning
  content: | 
    Note that <code class="scss-var">.navbar-item-right</code> does not have any effect on the navbar. When the bar is centered, this is ignored. If you want to undo this, see more details in the <a href="#" data="TODO">How</a> section.
