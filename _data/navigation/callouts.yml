navbar_container:
  kind: warning
  content: | 
      The <code>.navbar</code> element does not need a surrounding container. It will respect the <code>$container-width</code> variable and center the nav. <br /> <br /> <code>.container</code> elements contain padding by default. If you had a <code>.container.no-pad</code> element around a nav, it would function the same way.
navbar_full_width:
  kind: info
  content: | 
    Use the <code>.full-width</code> class if you want the navbar to expand to the full size of the screen.
navbar-item-right:
  kind: warning
  content: | 
    Note that <code class="scss-var">.navbar-item-right</code> does not have any effect on the navbar. When the bar is centered, this is ignored. If you want to undo this, see more details in the <a href="#" data="TODO">How</a> section.
