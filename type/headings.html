        <h3>Why</h3>
        <p>
          Type is important. It can be hard to find good settings for headers that are also
          responsive. Sartorial sets a ratio that deterines the relationship between each font-size
          instead of needing to manually define it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I decided to not require any classes for text and just add the styling to the heading tags
          directly to ease use.
        </p>

        <h3>Customize</h3>
        <h4>Font & Line Height Variables</h4>
        <p>
          The type sizes are built off of a base font-size and a ratio. Additionally, there are
          separate variables that can be used to build those up per media size. See the table below
          for what you can set and the defaults.
        </p>
        {% styled_table site.data.type.h %}

        <h4>Available Ratios</h4>
        <p>
          The ratio between the main height and the header size is based on an explicit ratio. You
          can either use one of these or your own. The ratios are set per media size:
        </p>
        {% styled_table site.data.globals.media_ratios_table %}
        <p>You can set your own ratio or use one of the below variables.</p>
        {% styled_table site.data.globals.ratios_table %}
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
